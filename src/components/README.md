# Components

Our components are a collection of interface elements that can be reused and composed to build discounts-focused apps.

---

## Getting started

The component library was designed to help developers quickly create the best experience for Shopify merchants.

Each component includes information to help you implement them, such as:

- Explanations of the merchant problem it solves in the interface
- Examples so you can see the component in action
- Best practices and guidelines to use the component correctly
