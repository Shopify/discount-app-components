# DiscountAppStategyCard

The Discount Application Strategy Card enables users to toggle between `discountApplicationStrategy`s to select between `All`, `First`, and `Maximum` strategies.

## Usage and best practices

- The discount code length only adjusts the default length of generated codes, and does not set a max length for the text input

## Examples

### Basic usage

<DiscountAppStategyCard
  strategy="All
/>
```
