### Feature requests

üåü Before requesting a feature, search the [existing feature requests](https://github.com/Shopify/discount-app-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+request%22). You can üëç feature requests to help the team set priorities. If a feature request is closed, you can still upvote!

### Pull Requests

üîÄ We welcome and encourage pull requests from everyone. Here's a quick guide on how to create one:

1. **Fork the repository** - Click on the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the repository page to do this.

2. **Clone the forked repository** - You can do this by going to your GitHub account, opening the forked repository, clicking on the 'Code' button, and then copying the URL. Open your terminal and use the command `git clone [URL]`.

3. **Navigate to the cloned repository** - Use the command `cd [repository-name]` to do this.

4. **Create a new branch** - Use the command `git checkout -b [branch-name]` to create a new branch.

5. **Make necessary changes and commit those changes** - After making your changes in the new branch, use the command `git add .` to add the changes. Then, commit those changes using the command `git commit -m "[commit message]"`.

6. **Push changes to GitHub** - Use the command `git push origin [branch-name]` to push your changes.

7. **Submit your changes for review** - If you go to your repository on GitHub, you‚Äôll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button to create a new pull request.

8. **Create a changeset to describe your changes**. This will help us manage versions and release notes. You can find instructions on how to create a changeset [here](https://github.com/Shopify/discount-app-components#typical-flow).

Please note that the pull request should have a clear title and description. If your pull request is related to an existing issue or feature request, please reference it in your description.
